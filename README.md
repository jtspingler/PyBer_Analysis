# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
In this project we looked at ride and city data across the world to better help understand the Ridesharing industry. Specifically, PyBer is the Ridesharing company that we were analyzing data for. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand how the different city types affect the prices but also how the intersection of city population affects this data as well. In the end PyBer should have the data available to make a strategic decision when it comes to expansion.

## Results

### Overview of City Types

### Ride Counts by City Type

We used box-and-whisker plots to compare ride data across the city types. Looking at the data we can see the only outlier was in rural cities at 39 rides. In rural cities the number of rides is at a much lower level than seen in Suburban and Urban city types (about 4x less). When we broke the data down using pie charts you can see that the data tells a similar story.

### Driver Counts by City Type

This data was fairly expected, and we did not see any outliers here. We would expect there to be more drivers in the city than there are in the suburban areas as well as rural areas. Similarly to above, the pie chart displayed this exact data.

### Fare Counts by City Type
Using the data provided, we can see that on average the most expensive rides will occur in the rural areas. This can be explained by supply / demand, as there are not as many drivers or riders in urban areas. Our multiple-line graph shows total weekly fares for each city type. Urban cities have the highest revenue in comparison to suburban and rural cities which is also expected.

## Summary
These are my recommendations after analyzing the provided data.
1.	I would like to see some more data specifically as it related to dates and some of the trends we see around different times of the year. I would be curious to see if seasonality changed any of the outcomes that I said were mostly predictable when looking at this data.
2.	In order to run a successful operation in a new potential market, there are more data points I'd like to gather, especially as it relates to demographic information. This will help understand who the customers are and what types of people are purchasing our product. 
3.	There is value in understanding how some of our competitors have entered the market. The Rideshare market is fairly saturated and I'm sure there are lessons to be learned from previous expansions into new markets.
